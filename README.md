Hackathon; (Adarsh, Aadi, Abhishek, Keval)


Hey so basically I'm just creating this for the 26th Oct Hackathon, Kodikon.

Keval suggested Github and I think thats a good idea so yeah.

I'll be putting all the relevant information (parameters).

Hopefully by the time you see this, ive collected atleast 80% of the information.
