FIrstly, we have some major questionnares:

GHQ (General Health Questionnaire)
    There are several versions of the GHQ, 12, 28, 30, 60. We will use 12 because thats the only one I could access for free online. Also easiest to implement.
PHQ1 (Patient Health Questionnaire)
    We are using the 9+1 version
PHQ2 (Physical Health Questionnaire)
    We are using the 15 version
PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)
    9+10 questions
CFQ (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire)
    11 questions
SF-36
    36 questions, not totally married to the idea
Total questions initally = 12+10+15+19+11 = 67

If we include SF-36, = 103

#

They are all scored individually, giving another set of parameters, which will also be scored on a scale of 1, 0 (good health , bad health)
0 will be considered potential adjustment disorder
1 will be considered potentially healthy

The generalized solutions can be applied to people falling in the category of 1, 0 has to be gauged differently

These set of extra questions has to be decided, and by Monday I should have done them for atleast 1 or 0, and they will be based off of what I talked to the Psychiatrist about.
Each test will have parameters stored individually in files. Have a look.
